# This repository is dedicated to solving the challenge proposed by the shape digital company

The challenge is presented below:

<br/>

The challenge was to create a Python API, but I have also created a front-end in React to consume the available endpoints.

**The front functionalities is presented below:**

The frontend is hosted on Netlify, click the link to see more: https://shapechallenge.netlify.app/

<br/>

The API is written in Python/Flask and hosted on Heroku.

**BASE URL:** `https://shapechallenge.herokuapp.com/`

The API has the following endpoints:

### Setup locally
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/GuiPimenta-Dev/desafio_shape.git
$ cd desafio_shape
```
### Configure environment variables
```bash
$ cp env_example.py env.py
```

Edit env.py and place your own Mongo DB credentials and collections

### Start the server
```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```
The server will start running at http://localhost:5000/

### Technologies used:
<br/>

**1. Docker**

* Docker is crucial to maintain application reliability by ensuring a standard version for all dependencies and environments.

* Used on local deploys.

 <br/>

**2. Flask**

* I chose to use Flask instead of Django due to the speed of development that the micro-framework would provide me when building the APIs.

* Used to build the endpoints.
 
<br/>
 

**3. Heroku**

* Great free cloud option for hosting back-end applications with CI/CD integrations.
     
* Used to host the API.

<br/>

      
**4. MongoDB**

 * MongoDB is a great choice for its performance and speed of development since complex relationships between tables were not needed.

 * Used to store data.

<br/>

**5. Netlify**
    
* Great free cloud option for hosting front-end applications with CI/CD integrations.

* Used to host the front-end.

 <br/>
 
**6. Python**

* My favorite language nowadays and it is mandatory for the challenge.

* Used to build the endpoints.
      
<br/>

**7. React**

* I chose React because it is the Javascript framework that I have the most control over.
      
* Used to build the front-end.

<br/>

**8. Swagger**

 * Great tool to facilitate the visualization of endpoints between different teams.

 * Used to build the API documentation.
